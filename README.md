### mateable 0.3.1 is now available on CRAN.

We added a vignette and many new features to this version.

### mateable 0.3.0

With this release you can organize mating scene data
(makeScene and simulateScene), visualize mating scenes
(plotScene, plot3DScene, and plotPotential), do some
basic analysis of mating scenes (synchrony, proximity,
compatibility), and a few other useful tasks
(matingSummary, overlap, etc.)!

### mateable
This repo provides source code for an R package called mateable. This package provides tools to simulate, manage, visualize, and analyze spatially and temporally explicit datasets of mating potential. It implements methods to calculate synchrony, proximity, and compatibility. 

To download the CRAN version of this package simple use the
standard command to do so:

install.packages("mateable")

To get the current development version you can use the package devtools, and the following code to automatically install package mateable.

install.packages("devtools") # if you don't already have it
library(devtools)
install_github("stuartWagenius/mateable")
library(mateable)
?mateable

You should see a help page. Click the index link at the bottom of the page to see what functions are available. Copy and paste the example code to see what happens!

Let me know if you have any questions.

If you are interested in contributing to this package, fork
the repo and modify/add functions as you see fit. After
modifying the repo, create test code that shows that the
modifications work in a variety of contexts. Also show that when the
modifications show error messages, they aren't indecipherable. Submit a
pull request with your test code and someone from the Echinacea
Project will review the code and accept, deny, or suggest
modifications to your changes.
For more advanced programmers, this packages uses Rcpp to take
advantage of the speed benefits of C++. If you think that
some part of this would be optimized through C++ programming,
add your code to the src/ folder and make sure that the package
builds.
Happy coding!
